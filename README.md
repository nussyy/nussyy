Hey there! I'm Nusra, an enthusiastic coder. I'm passionate about creating beautiful user experiences (UX) and have embarked on a journey to bring aesthetics and functionality together. Apart from coding, I'm also skilled in voice-over work and social media marketing. My upcoming  projects combines my love for coding and creativity in UX design, and I'm excited to share them with the GitHub community.
