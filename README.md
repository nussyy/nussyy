Hey there! I'm Nusra, an enthusiastic coder. I'm passionate about creating beautiful user experiences (UX) and have embarked on a journey to bring aesthetics and functionality together. Apart from coding, I'm also skilled in voice-over work and social media marketing. As a content writer, I take pride in creating engaging and informative content that resonates with the target audience.  My upcoming  projects combine my love for coding and creativity in UX design, and I'm excited to share them with the GitHub community and my upcoming project, contains well-structured documentation, and user guides to ensure users have a smooth onboarding experience.
